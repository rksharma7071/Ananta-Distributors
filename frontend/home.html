            I bought this about 4 months ago decided to go with the 8 pack was gonna go with the 4 pack 1 on each side of my 1990 GMC Suburban but knew my truck needed to shine just a bit brighter. The install was easy self explanatory, while unboxing I noticed how well this things are made they feel really tough and can withstand what’s to come. After installing I could see that I made the right decision going with Sunpie Rock lights the look is amazing and they are super easy to control with the BT controller and even the Downloadable Phone App was easy to set
up. Wish I could send a picture so you could see the outcome I’m sure it’ll persuade you to go with Sunpie for your LED needs. Thanks Sunpie for making my truck stand out like no other. A+++

            These things are pretty good. I have 2 different sets on my jeep and these are dimmer then the others but they light up a bigger area then the other ones. Only issue I have with them is the connectors from the controller to the wires where they plug in they just press in instead of press and screw like my other ones. Still love them will see how they do when I go wheeling!!!

            This one and the old one has a major design flaw. Once you run the wire throughout the car if one light goes bad you have to remove all the wiring for that line. Why not design it where we can easily remove the light without removing the whole wiring line by creating a connector between the light and the wire we have to run through the car. Seriously that would make things so much easier. The same way we can connect the wires to the bluetooth box have a connector design in the wiring part thats closer to the light. Easily remove and also putting them back and not do double work every time. One of my lights went out 2 days after now i have to do that whole thing back.

            I bought these to install on my MDX. I initially plan to use only six of the lights. But after some tinkering with them, I realized it four. one in each wheel was enough light for the fact that I was gone for. I tapped them into my headlight electrical wiring so that they turn on whenever the headlights are on. I debated tapping them into my fog lights so that I had control of them from my dash. Ultimately I went with the headlight. I didn't run the power button into the cab of the car since they are just power to the headlights and come on automatically when the headlights are on. I didn't mess with the colors or do the app. I just wanted pure white light. It's a very good quality lights and there's enough cable with them to do some cool stuff with them if you want to light up the underneath of your car. For my application they turned out great I definitely recommend them.
